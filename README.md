# What's this?
This is my personal dotfile :)

# Why this?
In case I get a new mac or chose to reset my current mac I'll be able to just clone this repo and all the apps/utilites I use will be 
installed right away!

# What's included in here?
- Some utils such as OhMyZsh!, SdkMan!, and Homebrew.
- Casks (mac apps) can be found under `casks` file
- Formulae's (terminal utils) can be fund under `formulae` file
